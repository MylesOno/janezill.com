                <br>Danish philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, claimed, “Life can only be understood backwards but must be lived forwards.”  I believe the “best” therapy takes advantage of our natural impulse to seek meaning by looking backward and forward, as well as inward and out, and in service of a preferred future and a preferred self.<br>
                <br>I am a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker (L.I.C.S.W.) and Certified Clinical Trauma Specialist with over 30 years of experience working with individuals and families impacted by illness, disability, and psychosocial and traumatic stress.  I earned a master’s degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I also earned a B.A. in philosophy and a Certificate in Women’s Studies. I’m also a clinical member of the American Diabetes Association.<br>
                <br>A client’s right to self-determination is a core value within the social work profession. I value collaborative therapeutic relationships.<br>
                <br>I welcome the use of story, intuition, art, dreams, and history in therapy, and recognize that community resources are often helpful. I offer EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), clinical hypnosis, and relaxation techniques to treat the effects of traumatic and chronic stress, and I incorporate a life-span development, family systems, and a social context perspective. <br>
                <br>Scientific research confirms the importance of a ‘person-in-environment’ approach when understanding the origins of human problems as up to 70% of the determinants of health are outside of an individual’s control.<br>
                <br>My fee is $130.00 a session unless I have a contract with your health insurance company.  I accept the following insurances: Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Harvard Pilgrim, Cigna, and Medicare. I am willing to discuss a sliding fee in certain circumstances.<br>
