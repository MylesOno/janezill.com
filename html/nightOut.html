        Therapists’ Night Out (TNO) is a free peer supervision, support, and educational group for mental health professionals that’s been meeting eight times a year since 2014.
        <br><br>
        Meetings typically include socializing, a presentation and discussion led by a colleague, and case consultation.
        <br><br>
        As a consulting group, TNO utilizes a process that captures the expertise within the group.  After a case is presented, those who choose to provide consultation begin with this simple statement, “If this case was mine, it would be about...” This approach utilizes the depth of expertise within the group and creates a broad exchange of ideas and perspectives.
        <br><br>
        TNO meets eight times a year, January–June, Sept & October, the second Thursday of the month.
        <br><br>
        The group is open-ended. Attendance at every meeting is not a requirement.
        <br><br>
